# BAmazonDB

This application is an Amazon storefront using node.js and mySQL.  It is a database of items available for sale.  The user gets a prompt to purchase an item after seeing all available items for sale.  (see attached file AmazonAppPage1.png).  After choosing the item id and answering the second question of how many they'd like to purchase it returns "Insufficient Quantity" if there aren't enough items with that item id available to purchase (see attached file AmazonAppPage2.png).  After successfully chosen an item and quantity that is available it tells the user "Order Successfully placed!" (see attached file AmazonAppPage3.png).  It then deducts that stock_quantity just purchased from the MySQL database.  (see attached file AmazonAppPage4.png) A successful order is done again (see attached file AmazonAppPage5.png) with results to stock notated in MySql database (see attached file AmazonAppPage6.png).
